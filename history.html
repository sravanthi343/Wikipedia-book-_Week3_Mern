<p><font size="4">A book is a structured presentation of recorded <a href="#" target="_self">information</a>,primarily verbal and graphical, through a medium. Originally physical,<a href="#" >electronic books </a>and<a href="#"> audiobooks</a> are now existent. Physical books are objects that contain printed material, mostly of writing and images. Modern books are typically composed 
of many pages <a href="#"  ></a>
<p><font size="4"><i>As a conceptual object, a book often refers to a written work of substantial length by one or more authors, which may also be distributed digitally as an electronic book (ebook). These kinds of works can be broadly classified into fiction (containing invented content, often narratives) and non-fiction (containing content intended as factual truth). But a physical book may not contain a written work: for example, it may contain only drawings, engravings, photographs, sheet music, puzzles, or removable content like paper dolls.</i></font></p>
